  Some math, just to test my mathjax script:
  $$ \int_a^b c $$

%h3 Endurance, Altitude and Payload Size (the size of the bubble)

%p Axis will come later, general trend is as expected.

%div#chart

%h3 Endurance vs Altitude

%p
  This chart shows all database entries that have a payload, designation, altitude and endurance. (~590 entries).
  Mouseover to see these entries. You can also zoom in through mouse dragging.

= high_chart("endurance_and_altitude_id", @h) do |c|
  = "options.tooltip.formatter = function() { return this.point.designation;}".html_safe

:css
  /*
  path {
    stroke-width: 2px;
    stroke: rgb(200,0,0);
  }
  */

  .point {
   fill: rgb(51, 156, 255);
   stroke-width:2px;
  }

%script{:language => "JavaScript"}
  = raw render :partial => "chart.js"

%p We want to show a simple plot of altitude, airspeed and persistence

%p I would also like to time available for each asset as a function of distance to target. I would like this to read from the database

%p I would also like to add the ability for a system to have_many :capabilities
