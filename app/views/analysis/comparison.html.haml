%h3 Endurance vs Altitude

%p
  This chart shows all database entries that have a payload, designation, altitude and endurance. (~590 entries).
  Mouseover to see these entries. You can also zoom in through mouse dragging.

%h3 Endurance vs Altitude by Propulsion Type

%p
  Same as above, but grouped by propulsion type. I am interested in which propulsion types enable access to different
  regions in this space. In particular, I am interested in what the different regions on this plot map to. Obviously,
  they each enable different capabilities and incur different costs, as well as impose engineering constraints.
  %b Click on a point to see details. Drag to zoom.

%p
  Next plot I want to do is to find the 'alpha' for these systems, which ones are more efficient? To what extent
  can they fly higher and farther with the same fuel weight? Not sure if this is a fair metric, but I'm interested in
  how uniform the efficiency of these options is.
