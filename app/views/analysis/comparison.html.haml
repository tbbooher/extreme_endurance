%h3 Endurance vs Altitude

%p
  This chart shows all database entries that have a payload, designation, altitude and endurance. (~590 entries).
  Mouseover to see these entries. You can also zoom in through mouse dragging.

= high_chart("endurance_and_altitude_id", @h) do |c|
  = "options.tooltip.formatter = function() { return this.point.designation;}".html_safe

%h3 Endurance vs Altitude by Propulsion Type

%p
  Same as above, but grouped by propulsion type. I am interested in which propulsion types enable access to different
  regions in this space.

= high_chart("by_propulsion_type_id", @h_propulsion) do |c|
  = "options.tooltip.formatter = function() { return this.point.designation;}".html_safe

  /*
  path {
    stroke-width: 2px;
    stroke: rgb(200,0,0);
  }
  */

  .point {
   fill: rgb(51, 156, 255);
   stroke-width:2px;
  }

%script{:language => "JavaScript"}
  = raw render :partial => "chart.js"

%p
  Next plot I want to do is a 'seeking alpha' for these systems, which ones are more efficient? They can do higher
  and farther with the same potential energy. Not sure if this is a fair metric, but I'm interested.
