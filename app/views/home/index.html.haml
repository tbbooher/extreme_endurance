%h3 Statement of Study

%p
  We want to understand what role high endurance UASs (HEUASs) should have in our ISR
  force. Specifically, we will answer, in order:
  %ul
    %li What are the differences between systems (performance and cost)?
    %li What is the business case with HEUASs inserted into the baseline and how do the various platform options compare?
    %li What force structure changes would be recommended from a consideration of HEUAS contributions 

%h3 Hypothesis

%p
  Our current ISR fleet could be more effective and realize cost efficiencies by a platform that can take off from a diverse array of bases, travel quickly to its intended destination, can operate at the right altitude and remain there as long as possible.

%h3 Key Interactions

%p
  Focused on thrust specific fuel consumption, we want to look at the endurance
  of the various platforms,
  %ul
    %li Endurance
    %li Speed
    %li Altitude
    %li Cost
    %li Payload (product of SWAP, ft^3, lb, KVA)

%p
  I need to explore the math of endurance.

%h3 Method
%p
  This is currently in work, but we are hoping to get at a simple description between systems using a framework such as d3.js to explore the trade space before starting models.

%p
  All data will be unclassified and intended at understanding interactions between systems. At some point, we will have to lock this site down as we bring in propritary information and then migrate our work elsewhere as we apply these technologies to specific scenarios.

%p
  You can do something cool, like
